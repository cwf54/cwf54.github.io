                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">In this lab, we are exploring the uses of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The sensor we are using is a board from Sparkfun that conveniently connected to the QWIIC breakout board the TOF sensors were connected to in Lab 3.</p>

                        <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary">The Sparkfun IMU board</span></div>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">This IMU contains a "3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis compass, and a Digital Motion Processor™" as per the data sheet. For this lab, we will be focusing on the data collected by the accelerometer and the gyroscope.</p>
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>

                    <h3>IMU Set Up</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To start, I connected the IMU to the Artemis via a QWIIC connector and the QWIIC connected board.</p>
                        <!-- connection picture-->
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Since this is a new component, I ran the first Example program in the SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino Library. This program prints out data from the ...? Here is a video of the values changing as I move the IMU.</p>

                    <h3>The Accelerometer</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Starting with the Accelerometer, we can start calculating pitch and roll. Using the equations given in the example code from lecture, I calculated these values like this:</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\PR_accel_equations.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">I printed these values to the Serial Monitor and tested their accuracy with known angular positions of the board. I used the flat table and the upright side of a sturdy box to represent the 0, 90, and -90 degree angle. Here is a video of this test:</p>
                        <!--angle video-->
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">While the data is accurate for the most part, it is quite noisy. To quantify this noise, I did a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis on 1024 pitch data points. I based my program on a Python FFT tutorial.</p>
                        <!--link tutorial-->
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Here is the program:</p>
                        <!-- add FFT code -->
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">And here is the FFT graph. While the peak at 0 Hz is clear, there is still a lot of data in the remaining bins.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\acc_before_LPF.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To combat this noise, I implemented a Low Pass Filter with the code given in lecture. I used 20 Hz as my cut-off frequency.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\LPF_code.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Here is what the FFT analysis on the pitch looks like with this filter. As you can see, the noise is minimized.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\acc_after_LPF.jpg" alt="">
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                    <h3>The Gyroscope</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">While the Low Pass Filter reduced the noise, there could still be less noise. Further more, using a filter like this can be timely and greatly slow down the sampling times of this importat data. We can introduce data from the gyroscope and using fusion sensing to get more accurate, less noisy, and smoother data for the pitch and the roll.While the Low Pass Filter reduced the noise, there could still be less noise.

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">First, I again used the example code from class to output pitch, roll, and yaw from the gyroscope alone.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\gyro_code.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Here is both the gyroscope and PR_accelerometer data.</p>
                        <!-- why are they different? -->
                        <!-- <img class="img-fluid" src="img\lab4\gyro_code.jpg"> -->
                        <!-- Serial Monitor of gyro and accel -->
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Once again I tested the values of these measurements with known positions of the IMU. Once again it was noisy.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">For sensor fusion, I used the complimentary filter code provided in lecture:</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\comp_filter_code.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Here is the FFT analysis on the pitch. It shows less noise than the low pass filter.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\pitch_after_comp.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To further exhibit the benefits of the sensor fusion, here are videos of the filtered pitch and roll outputs alongiside the indivual sensor outputs with known positions of the IMU.</p>
                        <!-- roll and pitch videos -->
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0"></p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0"></p>
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                    <h3>Sample Data</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Applying the same approach as Lab 3, I printed the current time using millis() before and after the IMU data was collected. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\sampling_time.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">It takes 3-4 milliseconds to collect the data. </p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">With this information, I made a new command in the program from lab 2 that would collect and send both the TOF and IMU data to my laptop. Here is the case for the command.</p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/cwf54/7b4855074b79c0a794664c419e80fb18.js"></script>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The command prints out the data in a similar format as the previous two labs as well. D1 and D2 refer to the two TOF sensors, P is pitch, R is roll, and Y is yaw.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\imu_data.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">This command sends back 5 seconds of data to my computer. Here is what the collected data looks like:</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab4\bluetooth.jpg" alt="">
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                    <h3>Connecting the Battery</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Now we can start powering the Artemtis with a battery. The car came with 2 650mAh batteries, and our kit came with 1 850mAh battery. Even though the weaker batter came with the car, it makes more sense to use the bigger batter to power the motors. These motors require more power than the board, and later in the semester, the extra time that the bigger battery can offer will be valuable.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To connect the 650mAh battery to the Artemis, I needed to cut the plug-in connected off of the battery and solder the wires to a connector that fits into the board. I cut and soldered carefully, working on one wire at a time and using Heat Shrink. Here is the finished battery connected to the Artemis.</p>

                    <h3>Stunt!</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">It's time to play with the car! First, I powered on the car and its remote and played around with the controls to see what the body was capable of. </p>
                        <!-- first video -->
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">It was a lot of fun to play with the car. It moved a lot faster than I thought it would, and it is pretty powerful. I enjoyed making it do flips by switching directions quickly. Also, it is very good at spinning in place.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">With some experience with the car, I secured the Artemis and the sensors onto the car (temporarily for now) with zip ties and tape, and I ran the TOF and IMU data collection command while driving forward then spinning.</p>

                    <h3>Pre-Lab</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Time of Flight sensors are used to detect how far something is, such as a wall. The final robot will use two of these sensors.</p> 
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\sensor.jpg" alt="..." />
                        <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary">picture from Polulu</span></div>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">With two sensors, it is worthwhile to consider where on the robot's body the sensors will be placed. It is natural to put one sensor at the front of the robot so that it does not hit walls head on. After that, I will put the other sensor on the right side of the robot.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\TOFbody.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">This side sensor will help detect when to take a turn. If it is at a corner where both the right and front sensors are detecting a close wall, it should take a left turn. If it was just in a region where the right wall was close and now it is far, maybe it should take a right turn. There would be better mobility with a third TOF sensor on the left side, but when the sensors are actually on the robot I can play around more with their placements.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The sensors communicate with the Artemis via I2C. To wire this system, I used a QWIIC breakout board from Sparkfun, and soldered the ends of the QWIIC cables to the TOF sensors. I also connected the XSHUT pin of one of the TOF sensors to a GPIO pin on the Artemis so that data can be read from both, which will be discussed more later in this write-up.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\TOFcircuit.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Here is what the actual circuit looks like:</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\TOFhardware.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>

                    <h3>Using One Sensor: Sensor Address</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Before jumping straight to getting data from both TOF sensors simultaneously, I started out by checking the address of the device with the Wire_I2C example program in the Apollo3 library.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\TOFaddress.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The address is 0x29. This address is how the Artemis will identify which device it is exchanging data with on the I2C SDA line.</p>
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>

                    <h3>Reading data from the Sensor</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Now to read distance data from the sensor, I ran the Read Distance example program from the SparkFun VL53L1X 4m Laser Distance Sensor Library.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">There are two modes to choose from: Short (max range is 1.3m) or Long (max range is 4m). For the purposes of this class, I chose the short distance mode. 4 meters is a long distance, especially to our relatively small robots (the sides are less than a foot long). Also, for the sake of not running into things, I want the robots to be able to accurately detect obstacles that are closer than 2 feet away.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The Long Distance mode is the default mode, so in the setup of the Arduino program, I called the function .setDistanceModeShort().</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To test the sensor's accuracy, I collected several of it's readings at known distances. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\distancegraph.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The sensor was very accurate up to about 2 feet away. Then it began underestimating increasingly. At 3.5 feet away, it read 3.14 feet away. This is manageable, and when using the sensors on the robot in the future, I will be cautious and take these underestimations into account.</p> 
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>

                    <h3>Two Sensors in Parallel</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The two TOF sensors have the same address. For the Artemis to be able to communicate with both chips in parallel, either the sensors need to alternate turning on and off during each read, or one of them needs a different address.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Basing my approach on Anya Probawo's Write Up from last year, I decided to change the address of one of the sensors. I soldered a wire from the XSHUT pin of one of the sensors to GPIO pin 8 on the Artemis. This wire allows me to shut down one of the sensors. During this shutdown in the setup of the Arduino program, I set the address of one of the sensors to 0x32.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\TOFshutdiwn.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Now the Artemis can communicate with both sensors without any mixup. Here are the readings from the sensors.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\sensordata.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                    
                    <h3>Timing of Data Reading</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Now we are interested in how long these sensor readings take. I read the time using millis() before the data was taken and again right after it was taken.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\timing code.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\timing.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">It can be seen that each reading takes 57 milliseconds. The bulk of this delay is from the sensor itself collecting data. If less data was collected, the delay would be shorter, but the results would be less accurate.</p>
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                    
                    <h3>Time Vs. Distance</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">With the sensors working, we can send their data to my laptop via Bluetooth using the command protocol from lab 2. I started out by creating a GET_TOF command.</p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/cwf54/60cf288c02317b8474ceb1059a18717f.js"></script>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The current time and two distance data points are sent to my laptop in the form of "T:(time)|D1:(distance1)|D2:(distance2)</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Then I modified the notification handler to read the individual data points and append them to their respective arrays.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab3pics\handler.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">With the arrays set up, I plotted them using MatPlotLib</p>

                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary">February 8, 2023</span></div>

                    <h3>Pre-Lab</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The set up for this Bluetooth lab requires running a python script on a computer and an Arduino sketch on the Artemis. To run the Python scripts, we are using a virtual environment software called Jupyter Lab. When Bluetooth is configured, the Python program running on my computer can send any of a set of fixed commands to and receive a response from the Artemis. </p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">There was some struggle with getting this system set up, but thanks to the wonderful TAs and collaborative efforts on Ed Discussion, a solution to setting up Jupyter Lab on Windows 11 was found using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). </p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We were given a Codebase for this lab which provided both a Python and an Arduino demo, and could already send a few commands and messages between the devices. </p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Before sending any commands or messages to each other, the devices must establish a connection. This is done with the Artemis's MAC address and a few common Universally Unique Identifiers  (UUIDs.) </p>
                    
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                        <h3>Configurations</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The first step was finding the Artemis's MAC address. Upon running the given Arduino program, the device's MAC address is printed in the Serial Monitor. This MAC address is then stored in connections.yaml on the Python side so that my laptop will know which device to search for.</p>
                        <!-- artemis mac address screenshot -->
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab2pics\MACaddress.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">I then generated a new UUID and stored it in both the Python and Arduino Programs</p>

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">With the Configuration set up, I went through the provided Python demo program to verify that the connection was working before trying to change or write any new code. Here is a video of a successful run through the demo.</p>

                        <h3>ECHO command</h3>
                    <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">After successfully getting through the demo, it was time to implement my own commands starting with an ECHO command. The Python program sends this command along with a string, and the Arduino should Echo the string back. Here is my code for how the Arduino handles an ECHO command:</p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/cwf54/a533eddb375c1170d08fb403db529db5.js"></script>
                    <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To verify, here is what the response looks like in the the Serial Monitor and Jupyter Lab.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab2pics\ECHOcommand.jpg" alt="..." /> 
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>

                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                        <h3>Get Time Comand</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To implement a command that returns a time stamp, I use an Arduino function called millis() which returns the number of milliseconds that have passed since the Arduino last restarted.</p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/cwf54/e5e1a8d9ce5264b996b739cb4b1a7ac8.js"></script>

                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                        <h3>Notification Handler</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Now that implementing commands is more natural, it is helpful to set up a notification handler, such that the string received form the Arduino can be received automatically (Notice that in the previous two examples I had to store the string into a variable "s" manually.)</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">For notifications I make use of two already existing functions: start_notify() and stop_notify(). Calling start_notify() requires a notification handler. This is a callback function which automatically stores the received string. To see what the notification handler has stored, I print that variable. Here is the notification handler working with the GET_TIME_MILLIS command that we got working earlier.</p>
                        <div style="position:relative;width:fit-content;height:fit-content;">
                            <a style="position:absolute;top:20px;right:1rem;opacity:0.8;" href="https://clipchamp.com/watch/J76ihkjY5sS?utm_source=embed&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=watch">

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To stop the notification handler, you just call stop_notify().</p>
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>

                        <h3>Get Temperature Comand</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Now let's start sending data from the Artemis to my laptop. Using the temperature reading setup from the Analog_Read example sketch (See Lab 1), here is the code for a Get Temperature command:</p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/cwf54/565f215b864a347b2b8e16e826ddf576.js"></script>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">This program samples the temperature sensor every second for 5 seconds, and then sends all 5 samples as well as their timestamps back to my laptop.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab2pics\GETTEMPcommand.jpg" alt="..."/> 
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>

                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                        <h3>RAPID Get Temperature Command</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">What if samples came into to my laptop much quicker than once a second? Most likely, they will. This final command will request as many samples as the Artemis can send in 5 seconds. Here is the Arduino code for it:</p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/cwf54/48e9b7d1513d9901e9ba27b4bb3a7fb6.js"></script>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Instead of concatenating all of the samples within the Arduino progam like I did in the previous command protocol, the board sends each sample one at a time. This is because we have defined the maximum character count for a sent string to be 151. With variable lengths of time stamps, it is safer to send one sample at a time, especially when you have a notification handler that will be able to store all of the incoming values.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">I created a new RAPID notification handler, which appends all of the incoming strings into one long string. Here is the new notification handler in action:</p>
                        <div style="position:relative;width:fit-content;height:fit-content;">
                            <a style="position:absolute;top:20px;right:1rem;opacity:0.8;" href="https://clipchamp.com/watch/MrEcAk6g0PH?utm_source=embed&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=watch">
                                <img style="height:22px;" src="https://clipchamp.com/e.svg" alt="Made with Clipchamp" />
                            </a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">As you can see, you can check on the strings while the command is still sending over the data. Also, the final data samples are the same, verifying that the notification handler worked properly.</p>    
                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>

                    <div class="flex-shrink-0"><span class="text-primary"></span></div>
                        <h3>Limitations</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Before getting too excited about sending hoards of information back and forth between my laptop and the Artemis, it is important to consider what the Artemis can handle. The board has 384 kBytes of RAM, which is 3,072,000 bits. This is how many bits the board could send at one time before something bad happens (maybe the board crashes, the Bluetooth connection is lost, etc.) Let's consider what this amount of RAM could send.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To be safe, let's use 20% of the RAM for Bluetooth communication. The board could be using its RAM for many other things. 20% is 614,400 bits.</p>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Looking ahead to Lab 3, the fastest I2C frequency of the Time of Flight sensors that we will be using is 400kHz. Let's consider a frequency of 100kHz. Asumming that data is sent in units of 2 bytes (16 bits), we could store data on the Artemis for 0.384 seconds befores sending it to my laptop.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets\lab2pics\limitations.jpg" alt="..."/> 

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">With smaller frequencies, we could store data for longer periods of time (proportionally). Recall that when the frequency was 1 Hz for the original GET TEMP command, we stored data for 5 seconds with no problem. If we knew we could use more RAM we could store data for longer as well, but again, if we have a notification handler, we could make the laptop do the work of appending the samples.</p>

                            <p>This first lab helped with becoming familiar with the Artemis board and 
                                uploading Arduino programs to it. After setting up the Arduino IDE on a lab computer, 
                                I ran 4 pre-written example programs on the board.   </p>

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The simplest program to run on any board is blinking an LED. 
                            Similar to outputting "Hello World," this program ensures that the system is set up properly.

                            Upon running this program, a series of print statements appear in the Serial Monitor.</p>

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Now testing the onboard testing sensor. Notice how in the beginning of the video, 
                                the temperature values are in the 32,200 count range. After I press my thumb onto the board, heating it up, 
                                the temperature increases to the 32,600 count range. After I release my thumb, the temperature drops back down to 32,200 counts.

                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The final example tests the microphone capabilities of the board. The Serial Monitor prints out the 
                            frequency the microphone detects, and when I whistle into the microphone, the frequency skyrockets to the 2000 Hz range.
