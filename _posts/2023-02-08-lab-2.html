<h2 class="section-heading">Pre-Lab</h2>
<p>The set up requires running a python script on a computer and an Arduino sketch on the Arduino. To run the Python scripts, we are using a virtual environment software called Jupyter Lab. When bluetooth is configured, the Python program running on my computer can send and receive messages to an from the Artemis. </p>
<p>There was some struggle with getting this set up to work, especially because it was believed that a Python program running on Windows 11 would not be able to Bluetooth connect with the Artemis. I initially set everything up on the lab computer, along with many other people in my lab section. We found however that there were still problems, as everyone's boards seemed to be connecting to everyone else's computers. Many people could not get through even the demo code provided in the Codebase.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the wonderful TAs and collaborative efforts on Ed Discussion, a solution to setting up Jupyter Lab on Windows 11 was found using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). </p>
<p>We were given a Codebase for this lab which provided both a Python and an Arduino demo. Before sending any commands or messages to each other, the devices must establish a connection. This is done with  the Artemis's MAC address and a common UUID. </p>
<p>Upon running the given Arduino program, the device's MAC address is printed in the Serial Monitor. We can then input this MAC address to the Python script so that the program knows which MAC address to search for.</p>
